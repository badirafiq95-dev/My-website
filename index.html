    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="glass-card">
      <p>
        I am a private person by nature and prefer to keep most aspects of my life to myself. 
        I do not enjoy talking to too many people and usually stay reserved, except with my brothers, 
        close friends, and those whom I deeply respect. Loyalty and respect matter a lot to me, 
        and I value a small, meaningful circle rather than a large social presence.
      </p>
      <p>
        My life has been mostly balanced — neither filled with extreme happiness nor deep negativity. 
        I believe this has helped me stay grounded and focused. I have a strong interest in coding 
        and enjoy exploring new technologies and understanding how modern systems work. 
        Learning technical concepts gives me a sense of purpose and curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaming is one of my favorite ways to relax. GTA V is my favorite game, and I also enjoy 
        playing PUBG/BGMI. Games help me sharpen my focus and provide a break from routine 
        while still challenging my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Academically, I am especially interested in Mathematics and Science. Among science subjects, 
        I enjoy Physics and Chemistry the most, mainly because I like understanding concepts deeply 
        and logically. Biology, however, does not interest me as much. I prefer subjects that involve 
        problem-solving, reasoning, and practical application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I am a calm, focused, and technology-driven person who values privacy, respect, 
        and knowledge. I may not speak much, but I observe, learn, and grow continuously.
